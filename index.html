				<h1>The Plantation South</h1>
				<h3><i>Chapter 11, Section 3</i></h3>
				<p class="major">Slavery was a highly controversial, divisive issue during the 1800s. As plantation owners in the South used more and more slaves, pressure in the North to end slavery grew.</p>

				<h2>The Cotton Kingdom</h2>
				<p>The Northern United States industrialized and urbanized, while the Southern United States remained mostly rural. The economy in the South was still entirely dependent on agriculture. Two events in the 1700s changed life in the South: a massive boom
					in textiles demand (related to the industrialization of the North), and an invention to help fulfill the demand. This invention was the cotton gin, invented in 1793 by Eli Whitney. It used a spiked cylinder to easily remove seeds from cotton fibers.
					The cotton gin increased efficiency by fifty-fold. Plantation owners made more and more profit from cotton farming. However, because of the increase in efficiency, more people were needed to pick cotton. So, once again, plantation owners turned to
					slavery. The slave population increased by over 3.3 million from 1790 to 1860. As time passed, pressure from the North to end slavery grew exponentially.

		<!-- Restrictions of Free African Americans -->

			<div class="content">
				<h2>Restrictions of Free African-Americans</h2>
				<p>African-Americans were deprived of their basic rights by laws, particularly in the South. This applied to not only enslaved African-Americans, but also the approximately 253000 free African-Americans. These laws mandated that African-Americans could
					only take the most menial jobs, could not attend public schools, could not vote, could not serve on juries, and could not testify against a white defendant in court. They were also strongly discouraged from travelling. Despite these extreme and inhumane
					restrictions, some free African Americans still managed to prosper and contribute to the United States as a whole. For example, Norbert Rillieux invented a method of refining sugar that made the process safer, cheaper, and faster.

		<!-- Life Under Slavery -->
		<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="three">
			<div class="content">
				<h2>Life Under Slavery</h2>
				<p>Enslaved African-Americans were even more deprived: they had no rights at all. Slave codes controlled everything in their lives. Slaves were treated as property, not people, and this was confirmed by a court ruling in Kentucky in 1828. Most slaves
					were forced to perform heavy farm labor, but some became skilled workers, keeping plantations running efficiently. Others worked as butlers, housekeepers, and other servant positions in their ownersâ€™ homes. Those who had to perform farm labor were
					often worked until they were about to die, and punished severely (often by whip) for any wrongdoing, however minor. The only reason they were not worked to death was because their owners saw them as property that needed to be kept healthy and working
					efficiently.

		<!-- Resistance to Slavery -->
		<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="four">
			<div class="content">
				<h2>Resistance to Slavery</h2>
				<p>Many African Americans performed actions of resistance, varying in degree. The most audacious fled to the North for freedom - though many were eventually recaptured. Other slaves deliberately damaged equipment, or feigned not understanding their instructions.
					These resistance efforts sometimes became rebellion. A famous case is Nat Turner, who led a slave revolt in 1831. Turner claimed he had a vision that told him to kill white people. His resistance killed about 60 whites. Many innocent African Americans
					were executed by slave owners in retaliation.
